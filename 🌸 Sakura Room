# 🌸 Sakura Room — OSINT Investigation Write-up

This is a documentation of my OSINT investigation in the **Sakura Room** on TryHackMe, created by OSINT Dojo.  
The room simulates tracking a cybercriminal using passive OSINT techniques.

## 🐾 Task 1 — Introduction

**Goal:** Start the investigation.

**Instructions:**  
Type the following to begin the room:

```

Let's Go!

````

**Notes:**  
- This task is the entry point for the investigation.  
- All following tasks build on this.

## 🐾 Task 2 — Tip Off

**Goal:** Identify the attacker’s username.

### 🔍 Background
A static image was left by the attacker. Inspecting the page may reveal metadata containing the attacker’s identity.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Methodology (Passive OSINT Only)

1. Open the page with the attacker’s image.  
2. View the page source (`Ctrl+U` or right-click → *View Page Source*).  
3. Search for the image filename or path.  
   - Found in the HTML:  
     ```
     filename="/home/SakuraSnowAngelAiko/Desktop/pwnedletter.png"
     ```
4. Extract the username from the path:  
   - Text between `/home/` and `/Desktop` → **SakuraSnowAngelAiko**

### ✅ Answer
**Username:** `SakuraSnowAngelAiko`

**Notes:**  
- The binary in `aria-label` is decorative and not relevant.  
- Metadata leaks like file paths can reveal usernames.

## 🐾 Task 3 — Social Media Footprint

**Goal:** Find the attacker’s full real name and email using their username.

### 🔍 Background
The attacker reused their username across multiple platforms. Username correlation can expose real personal information.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Methodology (Passive OSINT Only)

1. Start with the known username: `SakuraSnowAngelAiko`.  
2. Search social media platforms:  
   - X (Twitter) → `https://x.com/SakuraLoverAiko`  
   - Found reference to another account: `@AikoAbe3`  
3. Confirm account consistency and collect information:  
   - Real name found: **Aiko Abe**  
4. Find email in public artifacts (GitHub PGP key):  
````

[SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com](mailto:SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com)

```

### ✅ Answers

- **Full real name:** `Aiko Abe`  
- **Full email address:** `SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com`

### 💡 Notes
- Username correlation is a core OSINT technique.  
- Emails can appear in public keys, Git commits, or profile metadata.  
- Always verify accounts to avoid false positives.
